project-notes-adoptionApp.txt

made our boiler plate react app (in the current dir.) with: 
npx create-react-app adoption-app
& created the github repository so we can work from different devices;

We're using the udemy videos now, so this project/part starts on video 26 of the course: 
"The React Testing Library Bootcamp - The Developer Guide"  by Laith Harb
https://www.udemy.com/course/the-react-testing-library-bootcamp/learn/lecture/29987370#overview

So for time stamps I will have to say the video, then the time if needed, but I can try to wrap up each video;

about the app: 
more complicated than the signup-form app, so we'll learn more about RTL

Users will be able to look at the different cats, see the cats name, picture, and contact info (phone & email)
if they're insterested in adopting the cat; They also can 'favorite' cats they like by clicking a little heart
icon that gets filled out if they click on it (can favorite multiple cats);
Users can filter the cats by gender (M/F), or by favorites/!favorites, or a combo of the two filters; 

Addtionally, the data that is presented in the 'cat cards' won't be coming from our react app directly,
the data will come from http requests to another server;
We can inspect the page in our browser.. (maybe just in chrome, which might rule out using my old ass MBAir, or maybe 
I can still do it if I use an old version of chrome and just don't go beyond local host on the outdated chrome..?)
so inspect the page, go to network tab, refresh the page, you can find a request called 'cats' which shows data
coming  back from a server; 

We'll also learn how to handle http requests in our RTL tests, which is good.

vid 27: Breakdown of App
This is relatively large application so we can't just put all the code in the one App.js file like we did for the
signup-form-app; We're going to have to split this app into multiple components; 

What are those components going to be? What will occur in those components? 
The most obvious component--> The 'card' component; 
1. "Card" component will display each individual cat; 
This card component will take in some props (probably the best way to get the data into the component):
Name of cat
contact phone number
contact email
Favored or !Favored       --> and the card will take in these props, but other than that, it will be a 
straightforward component

2. "Cards" component is where all the individual "Card" components will live; 
Basically a big component to house the smaller components--> Cards is parent of Card in heirarchy; 
Multiple 'card' components will live in larger 'cards' component, not sure how I can restate this;
-"Cards" will get an array of objects that will contain information about the cats, and it will Map over them, 
and forEach Object, it's going to render a "Card" component; so also relatively simple, right? 

3. "Filter" component which will allow users to filter the cats

4. Overall component to group everything together will be called the "Pets" component
'Pets' will be responsible for making the http requests to our server in order to get the 
'cat data'. Once it gets the 'cat data' it will filter it based on the parameters passed 
from the 'Filter' component, then it will pass that filtered data to the 'Cards' component,
which will render that data as individual 'Card' components;

The web app/page will be structured something like this crude ascii diagram:

_________________________________________________
|             ___________________               |      ◄|'Pets'
| 'Filter'    |  {Card}  {Card} |   ◄ 'Cards'   |      ◄|       
|    |        |  {Card}  {Card} |               |      ◄|
|             |  {Card} ...     |               |      ◄|
|             |_________________|               |      ◄|
|_______________________________________________|


Where do we start to build all of these things? ?  We will start with the most basic component/element 
of our app, which is the 'Card'--in the next video; 

(video:)
#28
We'll start by running npx create-react-app adoption-app if we haven't already done so,
@30 sec:
then we'll make a 'components' folder w/in the src directory,
& this where all our components are going to live;

mkdir src/components/Card 
touch Card.js
